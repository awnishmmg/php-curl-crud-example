# PHP cURL CRUD Example

Example code to accompany [this YouTube video](https://tobeadded/).

Note that the [init_curl.php](init_curl.php) file contains a placeholder for an API key. DO NOT check this into source code control containing a valid key. To keep this codebase *as simple as possible*, it doesn't use a separate .env file containing sensitive data like this. It is recommended however that you use such a file to store the API key, and add it to a file like .gitignore.
